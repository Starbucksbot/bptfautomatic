# Automatic #

### Easy install ###
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) - 32 bit version for 32 bit systems or 64 bit version for 64 bit systems (4.0.0 minimum).
* [Download the latest version]
* Open the terminal/console and navigate to the 'automatic'  folder.
 "cd ./desktop/automatic"
* install all dependencies of an app, just type "npm install"
* Run `node automatic` in the terminal/console.

### Attention ###

* Do not place orders for keys. Buy orders will simply be ignored, and with sell orders, there may be a situation where your key's price is calculated twice, the price of the key itself plus the price of the placed order. Until this bug is fixed, do not make orders for Mann Co. Supply Crate Key.

### I get a specific error when I start the bot, what does it mean? ###
#### 'node' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file ####
Restart your computer.

#### %1 is not a valid Win32 application.
You need to install the proper versions for your Windows bitness (32 or 64 bit). So if you have a 32 bit Windows install, everything has to be 32 bit. If it's 64 bit, everything has to be 64 bit.

#### Cannot find module '...' (commonly 'C:\Windows\system32\bot')
Unzip the bot somewhere you like (such as your desktop folder).
